## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I really have to be mindful of the way that grid expands to fill up space - display:block and mobile first can really be helpful. 

### Continued development

I'm upset I got kind of stumped on why my padding kept getting messed up - I don't quite like having a lone media query to fix it, but I can't figure out what else to do. I also need to have a bit more confidence/review on art direction.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin's video](https://youtu.be/B2WL6KkqhLQ?si=bDsFvQYyX5OKy-g6) - I got stuck on fixing the problem above and who else but Kevin would remind me that display:block exists.
